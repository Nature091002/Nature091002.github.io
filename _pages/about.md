I completed my undergraduate course in the Division of Life Sciences at Korea University and obtained my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Life Sciences at KAIST under my advisor, Prof. Hyun jung Chung. During my integrated master's and Ddtoral program, I studied on the topic of "Engineered nanoparticle systems for gene therapeutic and diagnostics." Firstly, I developed lipid nanoparticles optimized to deliver the gene-editing tool CRISPR/Cas9 as a ribonucleoprotein. The optimized lipid nanoparticles delivered Cas9 and single guide RNA to various cancer cells and tumor tissues in mice, resulted in effective gene editing. Second, I developed stable lipid nanoparticles containing mRNA hybridized with lipid-conjugated oligonucleotides. The prepared lipid nanoparticles effectively delivered mRNA to cells and induced significant immune responses against the coronavirus. Finally, I developed an electrochemical-based sensor for diagnosing antibiotic resistance genes associated with bacterial pneumonia using CRISPR/dCas9 and polymer dots. The developed electrochemical sensor has been demonstrated to rapidly diagnose antibiotic resistance genes in clinical samples with high specificity and sensitivity compared to conventional antibiotic resistance tests and molecular diagnostic methods.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

I completed my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Life Sciences at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) under my advisor, [Prof. Hyun jung Chung](http://nanomedicine.kaist.ac.kr/professor/). 

My research focused on the topic of "Engineered nanoparticle systems for gene therapeutic and diagnostics." More specifically, I studied advanced nanoparticle systems for CRISPR/Cas9 cancer therapy, mRNA vaccination, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria detection. 

Currently, I am working on the development of an effective CRISPR/Cas9 mRNA delivery system via lipid nanoparticles for cancer therapy.

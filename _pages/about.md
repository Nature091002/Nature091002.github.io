I completed my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Life Sciences at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) under my advisor, Prof. Hyun jung Chung. 

My research focused on the topic of "Engineered nanoparticle systems for gene therapeutic and diagnostics." More specifically, I studied advanced nanoparticle systems for CRISPR/Cas9 cancer therapy, mRNA vaccination, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria detection. 

Currently, I am working on the development of an effective CRISPR/Cas9 mRNA delivery system via lipid nanoparticles for cancer therapy.
